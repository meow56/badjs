# badjs
 Takes 3 numbers and adds them together. That's it.
 ...but man, I think I must've done something wrong.
 For some reason, it's really slow at adding large numbers.
 Maybe you could help me debug it? :)
 
 This is my attempt to write the worst JS I possibly could.
 I don't know how to feel about this.
